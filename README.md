CS134 Class project
For my class project. I decided to do a personal website with information about myself.  During the project I learned about bootstrap
and how it makes the framework of a website nice and convinent to adjust.  I enjoyed the project and if I were to continue on with my
project I would most likely add more sections with more information about me that I could add such as more work experience in the future
and things such as that.
